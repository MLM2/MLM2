# 👋 Hi, I'm Mike McKeever

🎯 **Agile Program Leader | AI Policy Specialist | Python Learner | Cleared TS/SCI CI Poly**

Welcome to my GitHub! This is where I share my technical projects focused on responsible AI, data analysis, and project management. My goal is to bridge the gap between policy and technology — especially within the national security and intelligence domains.

## 🔍 What I'm Working On

- 🧠 **AI Risk Dashboard**: Demonstrating AI assurance workflows using MLflow, Fairlearn, and NIST AI RMF
- 🧪 **Transformer Security Checker**: Evaluating robustness and vulnerabilities in LLMs using adversarial attacks
- 📈 **Python Learning Sprint**: Data wrangling, geospatial mapping, time-series forecasting, and fairness evaluation
- 🌐 **Policy+Tech Portfolio**: Combining my experience at ODNI, DIA, ICE, and DHS with modern data tools
